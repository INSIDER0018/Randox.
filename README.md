## About The Project ( & Me )

With the first try of turning my design sketches into a real application, as you can see, it's just a simple random number extraction program.

This program was based on TurboWrap, an advanced Scratch Editor with more added functions like packing the project.

As a Chinese teenager, I started designing UI picecs at about 10 or 11 years old, learning all skills through explorations, and my design platform had been changed from PowerPoint (LOL) to XD, and finally - to Sketch. (if Figma considers giving more language options, maybe I will switch to it)

## How to Use it
