## About The Project ( & Me )

With the first try of turning my design sketches into a real application, as you can see, it's just a simple random number extraction program.

This program was based on TurboWarp, an advanced Scratch Editor with more added functions like packing the project.

As a Chinese teenager, I started designing UI picecs at about 10 or 11 years old, learning all skills through explorations, and my design platform had been changed from PowerPoint (LOL) to XD, and finally - to Sketch. (if Figma considers giving more language options, maybe I will switch to it)

## How to Use it

go to [the Release Page](https://github.com/INSIDER0018/randox/releases), find the edition you want and download it

### Step 2. Install

No Installation Program, so just run it directly.

With the window appearing, you can start using it. If you need help, go to [the Issues Page](https://github.com/INSIDER0018/randox/issues) or [The Guidelines (Still Working) ](https://github.com/INSIDER0018/randox).
